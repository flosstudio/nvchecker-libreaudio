# nvchecker-libreaudio

This is a [nvchecker](https://github.com/lilydjwg/nvchecker)-based, 
cross-distro version database for free/libre and open source
(FLOSS) audio (mostly music-making) programs.

## Background

This repo was inspired by the 
[archlinux-proaudio project](https://github.com/osam-cologne/archlinux-proaudio) maintained
by Open Source Audio Meeting Cologne. They were the first to use nvchecker for this
purpose and we simply started a parallel project based on the 
multimedia:proaudio (GeekosDAW) repository for openSUSE, with the goal of making the
data available to the larger FLOSS audio community.
